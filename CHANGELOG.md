- Remove note to build from a path that does not contain spaces due to an error when executing `gendef`. This is no longer required in Python 3.9+ due to https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/f5690925df897cf45818bf944b28d13f37b9f8ca.

## 19 August 2025

- Rebuild all packages to use https://github.com/adang1345/api-ms-win-core-path instead of https://github.com/nalexandru/api-ms-win-core-path-HACK. Use the Visual Studio 2022 toolset for all builds.
- Add 3.13.7.
- Replace 3.14.0rc1 with 3.14.0rc2.
